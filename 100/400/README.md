iClone 7 has a workaround for exporting video with a transparent background, also known as an alpha channel.  To export animation or other video with a transparent background in iClone, a image sequence can be made.  Once an image sequence is created, programs such as Adobe After Effects and Davinci Resolve can be used to transform the image sequence into a .MOV video file with a transparent background.  

This video walks through the steps to create a clean transparent background image sequence in iClone 7 or iClone 6.
